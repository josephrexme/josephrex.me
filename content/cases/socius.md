Socius is a startup based in Milwaukee and aimed at solving the nation's financial inequality
problem by providing financial education that is typically difficult to navigate or is so
expensive. Socius is a learning platform providing video content and quizzes to fill the
knowledge gap on finance.

## Website
[socius.education](http://socius.education) was created as a minimal landing page to pitch the goal of
Socius to potential investors and parties of interest.

For this website, a lot of things were kept simple with mostly just HTML and CSS. **Mapbox** was used for the map in
the contact area.
