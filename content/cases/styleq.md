StyleQ is a startup based in Milwaukee, WI. Its goal is to bridge the gap between professional
stylists and their customers by helping the customer search for expeerienced stylists. For
stylists without a shop or designated location to cater to customers, styleQ aims at providing
them a location to meet with their customers.

## Marketing site
The marketing website [bookstyleq.com](https://bookstyleq.com) was initially designed in **Affinity Designer**.

The website was built using **Next.js**, **Styled Components**, and a few set of related technologies to get
a website out in a short time.
