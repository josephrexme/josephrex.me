I have dabbled in various technologies over the years, on a quest for strengthening
my desire in creative coding/art. Here goes 30 days of canvas based generative art.
<!--more-->

Though I've made a little bit of generative art and I've worked with 2D canvas and webGL
several times, I still don't feel confident about my skills due to how sparingly
I use them in my daily software engineering role.

I initially planned this to be a sort of advent coding thing where I create generative
art from the first day of December 2021 through the last. Unfortuantely, things don't always
go as planned. So I'm still starting this in December 2021 but I am a little flexible
on when I put them out.

As I am relatively new to generative art, my mind is not as imaginative as I'd hope quite yet
so I'm beginning by following tutorials at https://generativeartistry.com/ until I start
building up ideas of my own.
