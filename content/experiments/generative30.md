I have dabbled in various technologies over the years, on a quest for strengthening
my desire in creative coding/art. But I am yet to repetitively solidify any of the
things I've explored. Though I've made generative art, though I've worked with
2D canvas and webGL, I still don't feel confident about my skills due to how sparingly
I use them.

I initially planned this to be a sort of advent coding thing when I create generative
art for 30 days in December 2021. Unfortuantely, things don't always go as planned.
So I'm still starting this in December 2021 but I am a little flexible on when I put
them out.

So let's get to it. 30 days of canvas based generative art.
