Do you dread emails? Have you ever tried to think about why you do if the answer to that
is yes? I think people hate emails because they think they have little control over it.
We get frustrated when we feel we have less control.

Remember [Google Inbox][1]? It transformed the relationship a lot of people had with
their emails. Beyond its visual appeal, it introduced some amazing features to users
that didn't require a lot of effort that power users would typically apply for an
enhanced email experience. Inbox did a lot of things I can't try to start naming without
leaving something out, so I'll let this video help with that.

With Inbox, people felt like they were able to take back control. It's the same feeling
you get when you figure out financial budgets and plans that work just right for you, or
when you figure out the right diet, eating habits, and workout routines that help you live
a healthy life.

How do we take back control in a world where there is no Google Inbox to make the problem
of emails seem like they have gone away? I would compare what Inbox did to us with emails
as what a weight loss tea does without extra effort to get in good eating habits. The
weight might come off a little, but we go right back to where we started if we keep the
same old habits. Like our health, fitness, and finances, email is somewhat inevitable in
our lives and we can either despise it and let it keep control or take back control by
learning to work with it. Here are the steps

### Step 1: An inventory of your emails
I found that I felt more confident about my home finances when I knew everything that
came in and came out of it monthly so well that I started paying a separate bank account
monthly to handle all payments, while being confident that no penny will ever leave our
primary checking account unless we're paying a credit card or some other intentional payment
triggered by me or my wife. I'll write more about this in an upcoming article on financial
architecture.

The equivalent of this for email is to know every email that come in and out of your inbox,
such that if you get added to some newsletter you are not intentional about, you can spot
it so quickly and unsubscribe from it or mark it as a spam. This sounds impossible
when you first think about it, and it gets even harder depending on your current email
situation.

### Step 2: Choose your client
Google Inbox was a great email client for a lot of people. You have to discover what
constitutes a great client for you. Have you ever gone email client hunting? or do you
just stick with the default client that comes with your email provider without knowing
what options are available. I think it's great to stick with the default client of your
provider after you've come to a conclusion from research, but I have [thoughts on sticking
only to the first options life gives us][2]. It's really worth researching
what email client to use as they are a part of our lives. I've gone from using _Outlook_,
to using _Apple Mail_, to _Airmail_, to _Polymail_, to _Canary Mail_, and finally to _Spark_
which is my client of choice. I learned something from each of the experiences using all
those clients and they helped me make an informed decision on why Spark should be my
client of choice.

Spark may not have the default powerful filters that Inbox provided, but it has some default
smart folders and an ability to create custom smart folders which are advanced filters.
I also love Spark for having the ability to snooze, pin, delegate and a lot of other amazing
features the Readdle team keeps adding. They describe some of the features in more detail
on this blog on [inbox zero][3] which brings us to the third step.

### Step 3: Inbox zero wisely
Inbox zero often gets a bad wrap for being a productivity placebo. The claims against it
address how it might encourage looking at your email more times than you blink in a day.

I agree it might indeed feel this way. Following my body fitness analogy I've used earlier,
I would compare this approach to inbox zero-ing as being so much of a fitness junky, that
it is an addiction. I do not encourage any form of addiction or obsession, so let's talk
about doing inbox zero right.

In another [article by Spark mail client][4], they describe our email inbox as our desk.
What does your desk look like?

On my desk I frequently get statements and bills from accounts we have, I don't get to those
immediately as they come. That'll be like waiting to receive every single email and taking
actions on them in that instant. Doing so will obstruct my workflow for anything else I might
have been working on. You do see a book I am currently reading. This is like a pinned
email that is not the priority at the time but something I'll get to. The only things you see on
my desk are things I am actively using or find I might be in need of. There's a notebook, a pen,
and a stylus, that I need multiple times a day but not as much as my keyboard and monitors.

I am able to keep my desk clear in a similar way I achieve inbox zero. By delegating the times in
a day that I address them. I used to think by simply having my emails go from _unread_ to _read_,
I had them taken care of. But this would be like reading a bill and leaving it right on my desk.

To throughly get a bill of my desk, I put in a drawer of documents. This is what the archive is
for emails. To do inbox zero right, you need to perform an action that leads to it getting off your
desk. You may **snooze** it to return at a latter time, you may **delete** it, **reply** to it while
ongoing, then **archive** all emails when done.

Spark groups my emails under 3 major categories which are _Newsletters_, _Notifications_, and _People_.
Here's my quick actions that applies for each of these categories. Delete notifications and some notifications,
archive others.

In step 1 we addressed keeping an inventory of your inbox. There are times you sign up for a software product
and get tricked into receiving their offers and promotion emails. These are classified as notifications
and a lot of people hesitate to unsubscribe from them as they think that doing so is somehow detaching from
the service, whereas you may still keep notifications while opting out of these newsletters. If you decided
to keep these newsletters, they are the newsletters you want to delete as you receive. All other newsletter
emails may have content you will want to reference in the future and that is why we archive those.

Following these steps make me feel in control of my email. They may not work for you the exact same way
but I hope there's a thing or two you might be able to derive from them.
