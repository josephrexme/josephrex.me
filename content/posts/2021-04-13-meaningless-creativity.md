In places where I can, I introduce myself as a creative technologist because it describes
all I do [better than any job title can](https://www.josephrex.me/life-with-segmented-purpose/). But beyond that, beyond being creative with
technology, the term describes the intersectionality of [STEAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics)
(Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math) with Art at the forefront.

My interpretation of putting art at the forefront of these disciplines is that the
end result of combining them is a product that can be exhibited in a realm of arts and
crafts. Something a lay man with no understanding of how it came to being can appreciate
and possibly desire to own. This is how I imagine creative technology.

For some, building the skills required for the kind of creative art I relish comes a lot
easier especially when it's what they've had to work with or what they studied in college.
One of such art is generative art. For a lot of software engineers who are bound to
building and architecting traditional web apps for software companies, they are often
stuck on improving the skills valuable to make them better at their daily jobs.

There's so much going on already at every stack of software engineering from deciding
between React, Vue, Svelte, Web Components, to deciding what database to use, to what
provisioning tool to use. I am one of such engineers still figuring out the
best ways to stay on top of skills I need to be good enough at what I'm getting paid
for, as well as the skills I simply just need to scratch my artistic itch, hoping they
may be applicable for work some day.

Various people have unique learning styles and one that I've found that works for me and
I think for a lot of other people, is pragmatic (active) learning. Learning through experimentation.
I can only speak for myself but it is incredibly difficult to pick up a book to learn a skill
without trying and failing at it first. This is why I resolved that the best way to learn
these skills I desire is by making things even when they are meaningless.

Steve Gardner (whose work I follow closely) talks about building meaningless things in his
video here.

This along with Simone Giertz's "Why you should make useless things" are big motivations
for the kinds of projects I work on

I am by no means at a point where I've made enough pointless/useless/meaningless things as I
would want and as such, I am behind on the skills I aim to polish from doing that.

When I realized my creative interest, I was living in Nigeria and had the most hours of each of
my day were without electricity. This meant I needed to do meaningful things in the little time
I could get both electricity and a stable internet connection[^1]. I hated that this was an
excuse I had preventing me from my creative dream. After moving to the US, I thought it would
be easy to take advantage of the better infrastructure to dive into a world of dedicating a lot
of time into research and experimentation. Unfortunately, for someone moving to the US alone with
very little funds, it takes a really long while to reach a level stability where that is feasible.

There will always be reasons and excuses why we cannot do the things we want to do. I am finally
at a point where I may consider my life to be somewhat stable and yet, it seemed I still could not
make time for what I had long desired to do for creativity. There are purchased books to be read,
adventures to be had, a dog to be taken care of[^2], meals to be cooked.

Regardless of the many responsibilities life may put on our shoulders, I believe we can always do
those extra things we want to do when we lower our expectations. I lower my creative expectation
by starting little projects and knowing I may not complete them in an expected time.
However, this does not matter as long as I make fractional contributions until I have a majestic piece.

[^1]: The internet service providers in Nigeria excel at abrupt interruptions but they can be fairly okay if you are paying them a lot of money. I paid more money monthly in Nigeria than I would for 2
months of internet in the US sometimes just to be able to have a steady connection.

[^2]: I can only imagine when human kids come into our lives. Right now I have to be there for my dog,
watch videos on how to be a better dog. It's an endless learning process for anyone who chooses to parent a human child or a pet.
