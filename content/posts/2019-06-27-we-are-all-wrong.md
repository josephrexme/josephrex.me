We hate being wrong as humans and that often clouds our judgement
in different situations. Even when we are certainly wrong but
have held on to a belief for so long, we let [confirmation bias][1]
impede our acknowledgement of the truth that we are wrong.

In the penultimate episode of The Big Bang Theory's season finale,
the vanity card had this:

I read the vanity cards from most episodes of the big bang theory and I was
especially happy to see that while we approached the finale, we got a very
powerful message to hold with us forever as the show comes to an end.

As humans, we all build a [mental model][2] based off of our backgrounds,
the things we were exposed to, and the ways our parents or guardians perceived
the world. Some of those lessons and knowledge that we have acquired might
have kept us long enough to the point we are but it does not exactly mean
they are right. Parents are often wrong and this is something I want to
keep reminding myself of when I do become a parent.

There is so much controversy and disagreement in the world because everyone
believe they are right, and aren't willing to make a shift of perspective to
view how other opinions may weigh against their opinions. I've always said
**change is hard** as I've also heard a lot of other people say and agree to
that fact. If we find it hard to change very little things like our choice
of music or choice of food, how much more our overall perspective on delicate
matters?

A smart friend of mine gave an interesting talk at a conference on community
disagreement in our software industry:

and the crux of the talk about getting along is that we have people with a great
lack of empathy who constantly make decisions that hurt other people without
realizing. Unfortunately, a lot of these people fail to admit how they are wrong
even when they are being told. This is also because we associate being wrong
with being a loser and that's an inaccurate association. Learning in life that it
takes several fails to get a win, it's only more evident that acceptance of
our wrongs is equivalent to taking a step to win. <mark>By being wrong we aren't losers, we
are losers when we fail to stop being wrong at the expense of the emotions of
everyone else around us</mark>.

We learn from biblical history that it takes penitence for a sinner to transition
into a saint. And as someone who chooses to learn through history rather than
re-making mistakes that have repeatedly led to bad outcomes, I choose to accept that
I am wrong when I realize I am. I also choose to suppress my confirmation bias.

An easy way to realize that our mental model of things might need some fine tuning
is often when we get a partner or associate closely with other people such as friends
or roommates. We tend to judge others about the actions they take that do not fit
into the way we perceived life for the majority of our lives and they judge us too
because we certainly do things that differ from the way they might have done things
in their lives. We can either choose to squawk and debate about who is wrong at
each other or choose to reach valuable conclusions where we both learn from each other.
Although, there are cases where the conclusion is that neither of the parties will
compromise to the perceptions of the other, we may also disagree in peace.

[Psychoanalysis][3] teaches that we are all wrong and we've always been wrong from birth.
The **Id** is dominant in us as infants, and it takes mental growth to build a **Super-ego**
that will balance out our wrong notions with moral and right actions. Babies bite,
babies have tantrums, and as they grow older, they learn these things are wrong and do
away with them. But we all know growth is physically stunted for some humans. Unfortunately,
there's mental growth stunt as well which results in adults with tantrums. A lot of this
kind of adults are in abundance on social media. They come as good and as bad and we
often take sides with either side of them. There are those who are definitely making
wrong statements based on wrong opinions they wouldn't concede on. There are also
those who overstretch their right opinions and truths till it [hurt others][4] and seemingly
becomes wrong. In the end, it's hard to tell who is right. So we are all wrong!
