A sudden twist in perception may occur in our lives sometimes. Sometimes it feels
like we have had our eyes shut before the new perception was gained and other times
it really is just a change from one perception to the other.

When I started using the phrase *point of realization* about 3 years ago, what it
simply meant to me was a **turning point** with a single occurence. A point to
realize your goals and directions in life as an individual, the point where you
stop living in fantasies and decide to take life more seriously, a point where
you do not just aspire success but are willing to take the right actions to
acquire it.

In this Joe Rogan's podcast with Naval Ravikant, Naval describes what I call point
of realization as.

To give an example, I grew up with a Nigerian dad who told impeccable stories about
his childhood academic success. This stories might have been true or absolute lies
but there was never a way to verify them and now even he might have forgotten what
the actual truth is by reinforcing his memory to believe what he thought he had to
tell his kids to make them strive for success. This was a known trend with Nigerian
parents and I can't speak much of other origins I didn't hail from.

The stories were irrelevant for my older brother as his intelligence and focus were
innate. He didn't need pep talks to study because books were pooped from his
consistent gaze upon them. And his grades put smiles to my parent's face like a
million dollar check will do to any average family.

Unlike my brother, I struggled with my grades and if someone had told me I was the
black sheep of my family (I wasn't), it wouldn't have meant a thing to me. I was just
a happy child who wanted to have fun and not be disturbed. I wasn't rebellious but
I wasn't an easy child either. I just chose fun over books. I loved art so I drew
over my school notes and didn't care to take down actual notes in classes.

As I grew older, the ways I had fun changed but I still tried to have fun and I put
that over dedication and focus in anything. I knew what success was and I wanted to
achieve it but I just wasn't acting towards it. So I question my perception at the
time. Did I really have a perception of life? or did I just have a definition of
life and success and regardlessly lived freely like a myopic bird? There were girls
in school who liked cool guys and the ones who liked smart guys. I seem to have
mostly attracted the former but the ones I was really interested in were the latter.
However, my actions didn't put me in their category. That still didn't change me.

I had a turning point suddenly after my high school/secondary education. I was just
ready to do things right for no reason or with no incentive at all. I can't tell
what triggered this part of me. It was just my point of self realization.

That was my definition of the phrase in this title and I really wanted to write
about it 3 years ago but I resiled. After relating the mind drafted article with my
real life encounters over the years, I realized that we do not have a single point of
realization in our lives, we just have big and small ones. After learning how to
treat myself to be successful in life, I still needed to learn how to treat people
around me. I needed to learn how to show love to people. I had lived freely for so
long with cynical opinions and about 2 years ago I experienced another point of
realization that made me learn to speak respectfully to all kind of humans and
appreciate everyone for who they are. Who knows what I'm yet to realize now? I look
forward to my next point of realization.
